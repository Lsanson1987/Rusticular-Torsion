## üîç Process

### Data Processing

- **Data Source**: The monster data was sourced from [AideDD](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd-filters/monsters.php). Using browser developer tools, a text file containing all monsters and their stats was extracted.
- **Conversion**: A Python script was used to parse the text file, isolate relevant information (e.g., name, armor class, and initiative modifier), and export it as a CSV file.
- **HashMap Integration**: The Rust program reads the CSV file to populate a `HashMap`, where the key is the monster name (a `String`) and the value is a `Monster` struct containing its attributes.

### Dice Rolling

- **Initiative Rolls**: When a monster is added from the database, its initiative is determined by rolling dice and applying its initiative modifier.

### Monster Struct

The `Monster` struct is used to store and manipulate monster data. Attributes include:

- `name` (String): The monster‚Äôs name.
- `hp` (u32): The monster‚Äôs hit points.
- `ac` (u32): The monster‚Äôs armor class.
- `initiative` (i32): The monster‚Äôs initiative score.
- `notes` (String): Additional information or notes.
