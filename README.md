# Dungeon Bus

A **D&D Omnibus** built in Rust, designed for tracking and assisting you throughout any D&D adventure.

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**  
This project is in the early stages of development. Many features are planned but have not been fully implemented yet. Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome!

## Planned Features

- **Initiative Tracking**: Sort the turn order of various monsters and players based on their initiative.
- **Autofill Monster Data**: Automatically fetch monster stats like hit points, armor class, initiative roll, and name from a backend database for quick setup.
- **Dice Roller for Initiative**: Roll for initiative directly within the app and apply modifiers automatically.
- **General Dice Roller**: A versatile dice roller for non-initiative rolls to handle any in-game checks or actions.
- **Website Frontend**: A web-based interface for users to interact with the tracker easily from any device.
